# DS-Web-Application

##  Here is a web based application for analysis of motor vehicle collisions in new york city with effective dashboard and visualizations.

The tools used for continuity of the applications are:
1. Streamlit
2. Python Language
3. Motor Vehicle Collision Dataset

Streamlit: Streamlit is an open-source python framework for building web apps for Machine Learning and Data Science. We can instantly develop web apps and deploy them easily using Streamlit. Streamlit allows you to write an app the same way you write a python code. Streamlit makes it seamless to work on the interactive loop of coding and viewing results in the web app.

Dataflow: Streamlit allows you to write an app the same way you write a python code. The streamlit has a distinctive data flow, any time something changes in your code or anything needs to be updated on the screen, streamlit reruns your python script entirely from the top to the bottom. This happens when the user interacts with the widgets like a select box or drop-down box or when the source code is changed.

If you have some costly operations while rerunning your web app, like loading data from databases, you can use streamlitâ€™s st.cache method to cache those datasets, so that it loads faster.

<b>Note: This code necessarily need streamlit installed in your system and running through the application through scripts.
