# Insurance Business Modelling

## This folder contains a simple streamlit web application that is used to do risk and revenue assessment for an insurance company using Risk Process.

In this simple dashboard I consider the average earned capital as a measure of profitability and the company ruin probability (on a fixed time interval) as a measure of risk. 

Evolution of the company's capital can be modelled by a stochastic process, the so-called Risk Process. Estimating ruin probability of an insurance company is an important practical problem.

In case of simplified Risk Process (in particular the Classical Risk Process) approximations are used to estimate the ruin probability. In a general case, we can apply Monte Carlo method, i.e. modeling stochastic trajectories of the company's reserves evolution.

### Classical Risk Process

The classical risk model was introduced by Lundberg, who first considered the problem of finding the ruin probability and gave the so-called Lundberg inequality. Since these works appeared before the development of the general theory of stochastic processes, their results were not quite mathematically rigorous.

The Classical Risk Process outlines an insurance firm with a starting capital u generated by cash premiums and claims. Premiums arrive at a consistent rate c>0, but claims occur at random times and with random values.

where  𝜉_𝑡  is the capital of the insurance company at the time moment  𝑡  ;

𝑢  is the initial state of the process (the initial capital of the company);

𝑐  is the rate of premium income;

𝑁𝑡  is the number of claims that arrived before time  𝑡 ;

𝑧𝑘,1≤𝑘≤𝑁𝑡  are independent identically distributed random variables (claims) with distribution function  𝐹(⋅)  and mean value  𝜇=∫𝑧𝑑𝐹(𝑧) .

In the classical risk process, the flow of claims is the Poisson process, i.e.  𝑁𝑡  is a discrete random variable with Poisson distribution,  𝑃𝑁𝑡=𝑘=((𝜆𝑡)/𝑘!)*(𝑒−𝜆𝑡).

### Ruin Probability

The theoretical foundation of ruin theory, known as the Cramér–Lundberg model (or classical compound-Poisson risk model, classical risk process or Poisson risk process) was introduced in 1903 by the Swedish actuary Filip Lundberg. Lundberg's work was republished in the 1930s by Harald Cramér.

The model describes an insurance company who experiences two opposing cash flows: incoming cash premiums and outgoing claims. Premiums arrive a constant rate c > 0 from customers and claims arrive according to a Poisson process Nt with intensity λ and are independent and identically distributed non-negative random variables Ei with distribution F and mean μ (they form a compound Poisson process). So for an insurer who starts with initial surplus x, the aggregate assets Xt are given by:

### Data

Starting off with INITIAL_CAPITAL, with premium arrival at a constant INCOME_INTENSITY rate, claims are independent and identically distributed non-negative random variables (here we consider exponentially distributed claim size with positive CLAIM_MEAN) and arrive according to a Poisson process with INCOME_INTENSITY rate.
